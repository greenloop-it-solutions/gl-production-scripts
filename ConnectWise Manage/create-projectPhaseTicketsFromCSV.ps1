# This script creates a set of sequentially numbered project sub-tickets from user contact information provided in a CSV. Tickets under the designated phase given the provided inputs.
# Each ticket will use the provided firstname, lastname, and email address and are suitable for creating a custom TimeZest invite for each user.
#currently does NOT populate phone numbers, so make sure to use a TimeZest appt. type that requires user to provide a callback number and populates it into the ticket!
